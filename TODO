Open TODO items:

* It would be nice to have a warning facility, which could complain
when, for example, you define sub-regions larger than their parent
regions (though it may be a legitimate thing to do).

* A way to specify the orientation of the coordinate system would be
nice, and would make dealing with Postscript a lot easier...

* There are a few conditions which should result in complaints or
failures, and which currently do not (eg, split_vertical() consuming
more area than is available should be a warning).


Contributing:

Suggestions (and patches) are very welcome.  You may (or may not!)
wish to know about some of my Generic Design Ideals for modules:

 #1 - Simple interface

The module should remain simple to use, and easy to figure out how to
use.  For example, I have a desire to keep the number of functions and
configuration possibilities to a useful minimum.  This should not,
however, impede the module's usefulness or usability.

 #2 - Efficient, and preferrably simple, implementation

Someone considering this module shouldn't have to worry much about
whether using it will entail performance or resource overhead.  Ease
of comprehension and maintenence of the code is critical, except where
it significantly interferes with efficiency or ideal #1.

 #3 - Restrained problem space

This module has a relatively modest purpose, and does not attempt to
be needlessly general.  In particular, features which provide better
applicability to a broader problem space at the expense of ideals #1
and #2 will probably be greeted with skepticism.
