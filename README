Data::Region version 0.9
==================

Data::Region - define hierarchical areas with behaviors

Data::Region allows you to easily define a set of nested (2-dimensional)
areas, defined by related coordinates, and to associate actions with
them.  The actions then be performed hierarchically from any root of
the tree.

Data::Region was written to provide an easy way to do simple page layout,
but has, perhaps, more general uses.
